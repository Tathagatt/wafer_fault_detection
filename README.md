**Wafer Fault Detection**
*Problem Statement:*
Wafer (In electronics), also called a slice or substrate, is a thin slice of semiconductor,
such as a crystalline silicon (c-Si), used for fabricationof integrated circuits and in photovoltaics,
to manufacture solar cells.

The inputs of various sensors for different wafers have been provided.
The goal is to build a machine learning model which predicts whether a wafer needs to be replaced or not
(i.e whether it is working or not) nased on the inputs from various sensors.
There are two classes: +1 and -1.
+1: Means that the wafer is in a working condition and it doesn't need to be replaced.
-1: Means that the wafer is faulty and it needa to be replaced.
